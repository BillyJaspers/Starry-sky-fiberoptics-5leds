# Starry-sky-fiberoptics-5leds
Starry sky for 5 leds used with fiberoptics


This is a script to randomly fade 5 LEDs from an average to a lower 
or higher brightness with random lower, higher and timing settings 
to look like a starry sky when used with fiberoptics.
In this case these will be implemented in a tie.

Up/down chance =  1/4 up, 3/4 down, with a maximum of 2 
going up to max at the same time.

Average stays the same.
Minimum, maximum and timing options change randomly
from 5 options every time it reaches the average again.
